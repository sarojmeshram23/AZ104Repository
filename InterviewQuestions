Interview Questions- AZ 104
1. What is Azure and what are its main components?
Azure is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft. Its main components include compute, storage, networking, database, and security services. These services can be used to build, deploy, and manage various types of applications and workloads in the cloud.

2. What is Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and how does it differ from classic deployment model?
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is a "deployment model" in Azure that enables you to manage resources as a group, known as a resource group. ARM allows you to deploy, update, and delete resources in a coordinated and predictable manner, 
whereas the classic deployment model is an older deployment model in Azure that does not have these capabilities.

3. What is a virtual network in Azure and what are its main components?
A virtual network in Azure is a representation of a network in the cloud. 
Its main components include subnets, network security groups, routes, and virtual network gateways. 
A virtual network enables you to create a secure and isolated network environment in the cloud to host your virtual machines and other resources.

4. What is Azure Active Directory (AD) and what are its main features?
Azure Active Directory (AD) is a cloud-based directory and identity management service provided by Microsoft.
Its main features include user and group management, single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and identity protection. 
Azure AD enables you to manage and secure your users, devices, and applications in the cloud.

5. What is the difference between an Azure storage account and an Azure file share?
An Azure storage account is a cloud-based storage solution that provides scalable and durable storage for various types of data, such as blobs, tables, queues, and files. 
Further, an Azure file share is a network file share that is hosted in Azure and is accessible via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. 
An Azure file share is stored in an Azure storage account, but it is a separate service from other storage services in the same account.

6. How can you secure data in Azure storage accounts?
You can secure data in Azure storage accounts by using encryption, access control, and monitoring. 
You can encrypt data at rest using Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) or client-side encryption. Also, you can control access to data using shared access signatures (SAS) or Azure Active Directory (AD) authentication.
You can monitor access to data using Azure Storage Analytics.

7. How can you configure and manage storage in Azure?
To configure and manage storage in Azure, you can follow these steps:
Create a storage account: A storage account is a logical container for storing data in Azure. 
You can create a storage account using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure Powershell.

Choose a storage account type: Azure offers two types of storage accounts: 
Blob storage and File storage.
You should choose a storage account type based on your specific data and performance requirements.
Set up data replication: Azure provides multiple options for replicating data across multiple regions, such as Geo-redundant storage and Zone-redundant storage. This will help you to protect your data against data loss or unavailability due to a disaster or other service disruption.
Manage access to storage: You can use Azure Active Directory (AD) to manage access to storage, and also configure Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to provide fine- grained control over access to your storage accounts and data.
Monitor storage performance and usage: Azure provides various tools and services, such as Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics, to help you monitor performance and usage of your storage accounts, and ensure that you are using the most cost-effective storage solutions.
Scale storage as needed: Azure provides the ability to scale storage up or down as needed, based on changes in your data and performance requirements. By following these steps, you can effectively configure and manage storage in Azure, and ensure that your data is secure, available, and performant.

8. Can you describe the process of deploying and managing virtual machines in Azure?
Here's the process of deploying and managing virtual machines in Azure:

Plan your virtual machine: Before deploying a virtual machine, you should plan the size and configuration of the virtual machine, as well as the storage, network, and security requirements for your workload.
Create a virtual machine: You can create a virtual machine using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure Powershell. During the creation process, you will need to specify the operating system, size, and storage options for your virtual machine.
Configure network settings: You will need to configure network settings for your virtual machine, including assigning a virtual IP address, creating a network security group, and configuring inbound and outbound firewall rules.
Manage access to the virtual machine: You can manage access to the virtual machine using Azure Active Directory (AD) or by creating and managing a custom username and password.
Monitor performance and usage: Azure provides tools such as Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics to help you monitor the performance and usage of your virtual machine, and identify any potential performance or resource utilization issues.
Scale the virtual machine: Azure provides the ability to scale up or down the size of a virtual machine, based on changes in your workload or performance requirements. 
Update and maintain the virtual machine: You should regularly update and maintain the virtual machine, including applying security updates, patches, and configuration changes, to keep it secure and running optimally.
By following these steps, you can effectively deploy and manage virtual machines in Azure, and ensure that your workloads are highly available, scalable, and secure.

9. What is Azure Backup and how does it work?
Azure Backup is a cloud-based backup solution provided by Microsoft Azure. It helps you protect your data and applications by creating backups and storing them in the Azure cloud. 
Here's how it works:
Data backup: Azure Backup can be used to backup various types of data, including on-premises servers, virtual machines in Azure, and files and folders from various
sources.
