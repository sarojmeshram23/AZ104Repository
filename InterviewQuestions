9. What is Azure Backup and how does it work?
Azure Backup is a cloud-based backup solution provided by Microsoft Azure. It helps you protect your data and applications by creating backups and storing them in the Azure cloud. 
Here's how it works:
Data backup: Azure Backup can be used to backup various types of data, including on-premises servers, virtual machines in Azure, and files and folders from various
sources. 
Backup schedule: You can set a backup schedule for your data, specifying how often backups should be taken, and for how long the backup data should be retained. 
Backup storage: The backup data is stored in the Azure cloud, in a secure and encrypted form. You can choose to store the backup data in a dedicated Azure Backup Vault, or in a Recovery Services Vault.
Backup retrieval: If you need to restore data from a backup, you can easily retrieve the data from the Azure Backup Vault. You can restore the data to its original location, or to a new location, and you can choose to restore the entire backup, or just specific files and folders.
Management and monitoring: Azure Backup provides a centralized management console, where you can view and manage all your backups, set backup policies, and monitor the status of backups.

By using Azure Backup, you can ensure that your data and applications are protected against data loss, and you can quickly restore data in the event of a disaster or data loss scenario. Azure Backup provides a secure and scalable backup solution, with the added benefit of being fully managed by Microsoft Azure.

10. Can you discuss the different types of disaster recovery solutions available in Azure?
Azure provides several disaster recovery solutions to help organizations protect their applications and data in the event of a disaster. Here are some of the most commonly used disaster recovery solutions in Azure:
Azure Site Recovery (ASR): ASR is a disaster-recovery solution that helps you replicate and recover your on-premises and Azure virtual machines (VMs) in the event of a disaster. It provides a streamlined process for replicating VMs to Azure, and enables you to test and perform disaster recovery drills without affecting production workloads. Azure Backup: Azure Backup is a cloud-based backup solution that helps you protect your data and applications by creating backups and storing them in the Azure cloud. You can use Azure Backup to protect your on-premises servers, Azure VMs, and other workloads.
Azure Storage Replication: Azure Storage Replication is a feature of Azure storage that provides options for replicating data within the same region, or between regions, to protect against data loss in the event of a disaster.
Azure SQL Database Geo-Replication: Azure SQL Database Geo-Replication is a disaster recovery solution that provides asynchronous replication of data between two or more Azure SQL Database instances in different regions.
Azure Express Route Disaster Recovery (DR): Azure Express Route DR provides a secondary Express Route connection to a disaster recovery site, enabling you to protect your workloads in the event of a disaster or network outage.
These are just a few of the disaster recovery solutions available in Azure. Organizations can choose the solution that best fits their specific requirements, and can use a combination of solutions to create a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy.

11. What is Microsoft Azure?
Azure is a cloud computing platform that was launched by Microsoft in Feb 2010. It's a cloud platform that helps in development, data storage, service hosting, and management.

12. What is Cloud Computing?
The term "cloud computing" refers to the process of storing and accessing data over the internet. However, it does not save any data on your computer's hard drive and only allows you to retrieve data from a remote server.

Explain the Importance of the role and how many types of roles are available in Windows Azure?
Roles are a very important concept in Windows Azure, and learning them is the base for further programming. Three types of roles in Windows Azure are:
Web Role: It deploys a website by using langue that has support of the IIS platform for running the web apps.
Worker Role: It helps you to execute the process that runs in the background by
VM Role: It helps you to schedule the windows services and task.

13. Explain command task in Microsoft Azure
When the system is running, a command task is an operational window that starts the flow of one or more common whiles.

14. What are unconnected lookups?
The input ins taken by the LKP procedure are unconnectedly looked up. User-defined values are ignored in unconnected lookups in this type of lookup procedure. Explain Cmdlet command of Microsoft Azure
A cmdlet is a command that can be used in the Microsoft PowerShell environment. Windows PowerShell uses the cmdlet to automate programs that run from the command line.

15.What is the use of the Migration Assistant tool in Azure Websites?
You can use the Migration Assistant programme to analyse your IIS installation. It assists you in determining which sites can move to the cloud. It also includes components that does not move or do not have support on the Azure platform.

16. What is Network virtual appliance?
Network virtual appliances or NVAs are virtual machines that control the flow of network traffic by controlling routing. A WAN optimizer, application-delivery controllers, routers, load balancers, proxies, and an SD-WAN edge are common components of an NVA. They commonly control traffic flowing from a perimeter network to other networks or subnets.

17. When to choose Virtual Network Peering?
Network communication between services in various virtual networks can be made possible by virtual network peering. When you need to integrate Azure virtual networks, virtual network peering should be your first choice because it's simple to set up and deploy, and it works across regions and subscriptions.

18. What are alias record?
Azure alias records enable a zone apex domain to reference other Azure resources from the DNS zone. You don't need to create complex redirection policies and an alias can also route all traffic through Traffic Manager.
The Azure alias record can point to the following Azure resources:
A Traffic Manager profile
Azure Content Delivery Network endpoints
A public IP resource
A front door profile
What is Azure DNS
Using a globally distributed name server architecture, Azure DNS allows you to host and administer your domains. Using your existing Azure credentials, you may manage all of your domains. Azure DNS serves as the domain's SOA. 
However, you cannot register a domain name using Azure DNS. To register your domain, you'll need to go through a third-party registrar.

19.How do you connect Virtual Network?
Virtual network peering is a technique for connecting virtual networks. Peering allows virtual network resources to communicate with one another. These virtual networks can be in different zones, allowing you to use Azure to build a global interconnected network.

I have some private servers on my premises, also I have distributed some of my workloads on the public cloud, what is this architecture called? 
This type of architecture would be a hybrid cloud because we are using both, the public cloud, and on-premises servers ie the private cloud.

20.What are the three main components of the Windows Azure platform?
Three most important components of the Windows Azure platform are:
Compute Storage
AppFabric

21.What is an Availability Set?
An availability set is a logical grouping of virtual machines that helps Azure understand how your application can constructed for redundancy and availability. 
When using Azure Premium Storage with a single VM, the Azure SLA applies to unscheduled maintenance events. To provide a highly available application and to achieve the 99.95 percent Azure SLA, it is suggested that two or more VMs be established inside an availability set.

22. what are fault Domains and Update Domains?
A fault domain, like a rack in an on-premise data centre, is a logical grouping of the underlying hardware that shares a common power source and network switch. The Azure platform distributes your VMs among various fault domains as you construct them inside an availability set. 
This method reduces the impact of physical hardware failures, network outages, and power outages.
An update domain is a logical collection of the underlying hardware that can offer service or reboot at the same time. 
The Azure platform distributes your VMs among various update domains as you build VMs inside an availability set. As the Azure platform undergoes periodic maintenance, this strategy ensures that at least one instance of your application is always running, but only one update domain restarts at a time. 

23.What is autoscaling in Azure?
Auto-scaling is a method of automatically increasing or decreasing the number of computer resources allocated to your program based on its current needs. The important aspect is that you can now create a scalable architecture that can automatically scale up or down to meet your demands over the lifespan of your setup, regardless of how fast or slow your site grows.
Here are the most popular ways of autoscaling:
Horizontal Scaling 
Vertical Scaling
What happens when you exhaust the maximum failed attempts for authenticating yourself via Azure AD?
To lock accounts, we employ a more advanced technique. This is determined by the request's IP address and the passwords submitted. The length of the lockout is also determined by the likelihood of an attack.

24.What is the difference between Service Bus Queues and Storage Queues?
The Azure Storage Queue is easy to use and has a nice developer experience. It makes use of the local Azure Storage Emulator, which makes debugging a breeze. You can quickly peek at the top 32 messages using the Azure Storage Queues tools, and if, the messages are in XML or JSON, you can visualise their contents right from Visual Studio. Furthermore, the contents of these queues can cleanse, which is particularly valuable during development and quality assurance operations. The Azure Service Bus Queues, on the other hand, have a number of beneficial processes that make them enterprise-worthy! They're part of the Service Bus and can pass messages through to other Queues and Topics. They feature a built-in dead-letter queue, and messages have a time limit that you choose, so messages don't vanish after seven days.
My web app still uses an old Docker container image after I've updated the image on Docker Hub. Does Azure support continuous integration/deployment of custom
containers?
It certainly does. You can update the container for private registries by stopping and restarting your web app. You can also force an update of your container by changing or adding a mock application option.

25. What are the three types of RBAC controls in Microsoft Azure? 
The three different types of roles are :
